## Workout03 - Google Scholar Citations Data Analysis
****

This project will consist of some basic to advanced data analysis and visualizations on citations datasets of two selected google scholars. The selected scholars are both recent Nobel laureates in Economics, namely Richard Thaler and William Nordhaus. Analysis will be done on all the recorded information in both datasets using regular expressions to manipulate strings. The analysed data will also be visualized in a set of plots that show certain trends of meaningful information in the dataset.
